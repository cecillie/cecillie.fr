Former Creative director of Ultranoir, Uzful and Baobaz, trained at Publicis, I now work as a freelance.
For 15 years I’ve been glad to collaborate with fine brands such as [Galeries Lafayette](https://www.behance.net/gallery/74355515/galeries-lafayette), [Dior](https://www.behance.net/gallery/73040331/dior-backstage), [Leroy Merlin](https://www.behance.net/gallery/74693899/du-cot-de-chez-vous), [Bayard Jeunesse](https://www.behance.net/gallery/73864429/bayard-jeunesse) and many more.

I also draw a lot of *Paysages à Vélo* on [shop.cecillie.fr](https://shop.cecillie.fr).
