Former Creative director of Ultranoir, Uzful and Baobaz, trained at Publicis, I work as a freelance.
For 15 years I’ve been glad to collaborate with fine brands such as Galeries Lafayette, Dior, Leroy Merlin, Bayard Jeunesse and many more.

I also draw a lot of *Paysages à Vélo* on [shop.cecillie.fr](https://shop.cecillie.fr).

Take a look at my [Instagram feed](https://www.instagram.com/cecile.ricordeau/) to discover my universe and my illustrations.
